This is a Node based REST API that provides a management system for movies and subscriptions.

Only authorized users can log in to the web site. The first user is the Admin and only he can manage other users (create, change & remove).

The system starts with only one (pre-defined) record of the System Admin data (both in the json files and in the data base).
